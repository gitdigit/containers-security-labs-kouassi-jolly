A Docker container is a standardized, encapsulated environement that runs applications. Docker containers run on any machine or virtual machine where the Docker engine is installed. And they run without knowledge of the underlying system architecture. 

A Docker image is a standardized package that includes all the files, binaries, libraries, and configurations to run a container.
